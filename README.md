Lan - Battle

Mega Man Battle Network like game. 

WASD to move
Tap J to charge a blast, tap j once more to release a charged shot.
There are 4 levels of charge.
Pressing L when chip select is ready will give you temporary powerups that last until the next time chip select is available  
Insanely buggy
Hour 89: Only computer boss and wave boss is working, rock boss is working a little. All fodder enemies stages should be working for each boss. Tutorial somewhat works, press i if you've cleared all the enemies in a area.
